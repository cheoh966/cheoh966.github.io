						But you don't necessarily have to be tan!<br>
						If your skin is pale, but more ivory than pink,<br>
						you fall into this category as well.<br>
						A good test is to look at a visible vein.<br>
						If it appears green, <br>
						You probably fall into this category<br></h5> 
					<a href="TA_1_2.html"> <h1 style="color:pink;">Pink undertones</h1> </a>
						<h5 style="color:pink;"> If your skin is rosier in complexion,<br>
							you probably belong in this group.<br>
							If you aren't sure, look at a visible vein.<br>
							If it appears blue-ish, <br>
						you probably fall into this category.</h5>
